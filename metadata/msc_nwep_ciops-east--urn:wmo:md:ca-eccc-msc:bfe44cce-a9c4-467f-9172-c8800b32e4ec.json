        "description": "The Coastal Ice Ocean Predicton System (CIOPS) provides a 48 hour ocean and ice forecast over different domains (East, West, Salish Sea) four times a day at 1/36\u00b0 resolution. A pseudo-analysis component is forced at the ocean boundaries by the Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) forecasts and spectrally nudged to the RIOPS solution in the deep ocean. Fields from the pseudo-analysis are used to initialize the 00Z forecast, whilst the 06, 12 and 18Z forecasts use a restart files saved at hour 6 from the previous forecast. The atmospheric fluxes for both the pseudo-analysis and forecast components are provided by the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) blended both spatially and temporally with either the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) (for CIOPS-East) or an uncoupled component of the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) at 10km horizontal resolution (for CIOPS-West) for areas not covered by the HRDPS. The ocean-ice forecasts from the CIOPS-East and CIOPS-West systems are available as hourly products. These products are available in NetCDF format on a latitude and longitude grid. The CIOPS-East domain covers the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the North West Atlantic and the east coast of Canada at a resolution of 2km (0.03 x 0.02 degree). The CIOPS-West main domain covers the North East Pacific and the west coast of Canada, also at a resolution of 2km (0.03 x 0.02 degree). The CIOPS-West system also outputs a regional enhancement at 500m resolution (0.008 x 0.005 degree) that covers the Salish Sea region only.",
