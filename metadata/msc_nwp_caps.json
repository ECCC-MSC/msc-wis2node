        "description": "The Canadian Arctic Prediction System (CAPS) provides an important contribution to various scientific experiments that are part of the Year of polar prediction (YOPP) and provides km-scale NWP forecasts for the canadian Arctic. The CAPS is a GEM-based deterministic prediction system, very similar to the current High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System North domain (HRDPS-North) which will be replaced by the CAPS. CAPS is downscaled from ECCC's Global Deterministic Prediction System, the GDPS, which provides initial conditions and lateral boundary conditions for the atmospheric fields.  In the current system, which is not yet coupled to the ice-ocean prediction system, all initial surface fields come from the global configuration of the land-data assimilation system, CaLDAS. The system is running on a 3 km domain of 2250 x 1850 horizontal grid points (covering the entire Arctic basin and Hudson Bay) and 62 vertical levels. The major differences between CAPS and the current HRDPS is the introduction of the predicted particle properties (P3) cloud microphysics scheme, which is responsible for parameterizing the grid-scale clouds and precipitation.",
