Only a subset of the total stations found on Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Historical Climate Data Page is shown due to size limitations.The priorities for inclusion are as follows: stations in cities with populations of 10000+, stations that are Regional Basic Climatological Network status and stations with 30+ years of data.",
