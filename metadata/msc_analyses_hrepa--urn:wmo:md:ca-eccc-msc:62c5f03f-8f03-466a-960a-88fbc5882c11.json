        "description": "The High Resolution Ensemble Precipitation Analysis (HREPA) is part of the NSRPS (National Surface and River Prediction System) system dependent on two other systems. It uses surface station observations and radar QPEs pre-processed by the High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (HRDPA) and disturbed trial fields generated by the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS). HREPA produces four precipitation analyses per day on 6-hour accumulations valid at synoptic times (00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC). Each analysis set contains 24 members plus the control member. A quality index (confidence index) is also available on the same grid as the precipitation fields. Finally, two percentiles, 25th and 75th, estimated on these sets are also provided for each synoptic hour. Currently, there is only a high-resolution version of the system, whose domain covers Canada and the northern United States with a horizontal resolution of about 2.5km.",
