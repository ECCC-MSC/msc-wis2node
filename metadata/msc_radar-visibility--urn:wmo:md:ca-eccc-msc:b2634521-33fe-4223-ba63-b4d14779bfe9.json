        "description": "Wind turbines can contaminate weather radar data which can compromise Environment and Climate Change Canada’s (ECCC) ability to provide quality weather forecasts and warnings to Canadians. In support of ECCC’s wind farm and weather radar siting guidelines, weather radar visibility layers were created for 150, 200 and 250 meters above ground level (mAGL) surface heights, which are representative of typical past and present wind turbine heights (base-to-tip or total) as well as potential future turbine heights given the trend. These visibility layers were generated from a viewshed analysis using ECCC’s 32 operational S-Band weather radars as observers and the three abovementioned heights as surface offsets. Within these visibility layers, turbines that are 150, 200 and 250 mAGL tall are likely to be visible to ECCC’s operational weather radars and therefore have the potential to contaminate weather radar data. A polygon layer containing 10 and 60 kilometer radius buffers around each radar denoting the turbine-radar impact zones are also included in this dataset.",
